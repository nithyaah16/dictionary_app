# DICTIONARY APP

## What does the app do?

This is a simple dictionary app which gets a word from the user and gives back the definition.

If the word has a typo or if the word does not exist instead of showing error, the dictionary tries to guess the word by getting close matches of the word entered.

The dictionary asks the user to enter a simple yes or no command whether they would like to continue with the app
after displaying the definition result. If yes, the user can continue or else the app terminates with a thank you note.
